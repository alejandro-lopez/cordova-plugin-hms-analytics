## 1. Contents

The Cordova SDK code encapsulates the Huawei analytics client interface. It provides many APIs for your reference or use.

  

The Cordova SDK code package is described as follows:

  

**src/android**: core layer, bridging AnalyticsSDK bottom-layer code;

  

**www/HMSAnalytics.js**: external interface definition layer, which is used to define interface classes or reference files.

  
  

## 2. Installation Guide


1. Download the Cordova Analytics SDK Plugin.

2.  Add Platform To Project.

    ***`cordova platform add android`***

3. Run the following command in the root directory of the Cordova project:

	***`cordova plugin add PATH_TO_CORDOVA_ANALYTICS_SDK`***

4. Check whether the Cordova Analytics SDK is successfully added to Plugin folder in the root directory of the Cordova project.

5. Add agconnect-services.json and jks file to root directory. 

6. Add build.json file to your project's root.

7. Import required package and add following code to onCreate function in MainActivity.java inside platforms\android\app\src\main\java .


8. Then run the Cordova app and check whether the automatically collected event can be properly reported in the **Real-time analysis** menu on the **Advanced analysis** page in HUAWEI Developer.
        
    ***`cordova run android`***

## Public Functions

  

### enableLog(success, error)

  

Enables the console log function of the SDK. The default level is DEBUG.

  

| Parameters | Definition |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|success | A callback function. It is called when function is executed successfully.|
|error| A callback function. It is called when function is failed.|

  

### enableLogWithLevel( logLevel, success, error)

  

Enables the console log function of the SDK. The log level is passed.

|userId| Indicates the user ID.This parameter cannot be empty and its value can contain a maximum of 256 characters.|
|success | A callback function. It is called when function is executed successfully.|
|error| A callback function. It is called when function is failed.|

  

### setUserProfile(key, value, success, error)

This API is called to set user attributes.The values of user attributes remain unchanged throughout the app lifecycle and during each session.A maximum of 25 user attributes are supported. If the name of an attribute set later is the same as that of an existing attribute, the value of the existing attribute is updated.

  
  

| Parameters | Definition |
